Summary of Program:
This game is a game of hangman that picks one word from a random fact based on a historical event that happened in a random year. The historical statement which has all the words is displayed to allow the user to make guesses based on the word in the statement. The number of guesses allowed is the number next to "Number is:" and that is based on a randomly performed mathamatical calculation between 2 numbers between 1 and 10.
